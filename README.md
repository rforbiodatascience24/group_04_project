## Data
This repository contains the R4BDS final project in which the dataset of the following publication was analyzed: "*RNA sequencing of bone marrow CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and healthy controls*", identifer GSE114922.

Data is downloaded automatically via the script "01_load_and_tidy", or via the holistic script "00_all". If manual data retrieval is desired, the data can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE114922).

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to showcase the tools thaught in the course R4BDS while presenting interesting insights into the data used. The tools used include but are not limited to:
data retrieval, data tidying, joining of dataframes, statistical analysis of data, modelling of data and visualization of data with ggplot etc. 
Additionally, collaborative working via a version control service like github is achieved.

## Scientific aim of the project
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are cancer diseases of the hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Identification of differences in gene expression between patient hematopoietic cell lines and healthy donor hematopoietic cell lines could reveal potential drugable targets in MDS. Hence, we performed differential gene expression analyses on the dataset outlines above and show which genes are up- and downregulated in both hematopoietic stem cells and erythroid, granulocytic and monocytic progenitors.
