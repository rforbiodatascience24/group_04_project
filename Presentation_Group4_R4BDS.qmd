## Introduction {data-background="IMG_0825.JPG"}

<div>

-   The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a diverse set of cancers in the bone marrow.
-   The bone marrow consists of several cell types - amongst these hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells.
-   Gene expression analysis of specific cell fractions derived from the bone marrow could reveal potential targets of therapy and immune evasive mechanisms.

## Materials and methods: Data Retrieval and Cleaning

-   Data identified on the Gene Expression Omnibus server: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE19429>

-   Two data files - the sample data and the raw count data.

## Methods: Gene Mapping, Cleanup and DESeq2 Analysis

## Transforming and Joining Data (maybe we don't need that as we kinda cover it in the previous slided)

This is some text

## Sample compositions

## Distribution of counts

Nithiya's histograms of count distribution.

## Clustering using PCA on all cells and on HSC

## Clustering analysis using K-means (k = 4) and UMAP (TheaÂ´s creation)

## Differential gene expression: All samples and HSC

Edir's analyses

## Differential gene expression across the different cell populations - MDS vs. HD

The figure we talked about Edir.

I think that we could just discuss the outlooks by looking at the figure
