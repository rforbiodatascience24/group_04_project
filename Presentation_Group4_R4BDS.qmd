-   The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a diverse set of cancers in the bone marrow.
-   The bone marrow consists of several cell types - amongst these hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells.
-   Gene expression analysis of specific cell fractions derived from the bone marrow could reveal potential targets of therapy and immune evasive mechanisms.
