## Introduction {data-background="IMG_0825.JPG"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a diverse set of cancers in the bone marrow.
-   The bone marrow consists of several cell types - amongst these hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells.
-   Gene expression analysis of specific cell fractions derived from the bone marrow could reveal potential targets of therapy and immune evasive mechanisms.

## Distribution of counts

The histograms above illustrate gene counts from both MDS patients and healthy donors, displayed before and after normalization.

The impact of normalization appears subtle. However, it is noticeable that the overall gene counts in MDS patients are comparatively higher than those in healthy donors.

## Conclusion and perspectives

-   Several genes are differentially expressed between healthy donors and patients with MDS in the four analyzed cell populations.

-   Single cell analysis (RNASeq or proteomics) would provide further detail.

-   Differences in expression between the *SF3B1*/*SRSF2* mutants and wild types?

-   More sample/clinical data on MDS samples would allow to analyze these more in deeply and gain more knowledge of differential gene expression between different classes of MDS.
